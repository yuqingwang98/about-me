        Hey, I'm Yuqing, an EdTech freelance teacher based in London.
        After studying for a Master's degree in Urban Planning and Development,
        I started my journey of web development in 2022. I code in Python and JavaScript.
        <br><br>
        I am passionate about learning new
        things and hope to apply my skills to create beautiful and functional Web apps.

      <h2>Why Web Development?</h2>
      <button id='button2' class="toggle-button">Show/Hide</button>
      <p id="answer" class="hidden">
        My tech journey began with data science, driven by my love for Python.
        However, I quickly realized that I wanted to build something more
        practical and enjoyable, beyond cleaning data and training models.
        <br><br>
        As a result, I delved into responsive web design through Free Codecamp and
        completed The Odin Project's introduction track. I'm currently on track to
        finish the University of Helsinki's Full Stack Open course by March, bringing
        me closer to my dream of becoming a web developer.
        <br><br>
        But it's not just about acquiring new skills. I'm also eager to connect
        with like-minded individuals and collaborate on projects. After hesitating
        for a while, I was able to complete projects with the help of the Founders
        and Coders' Wednesday meetup group.
        <br><br>
        I'm looking forward to continuing to learn and grow with the community.
