      <p id="description">
        Hey, I'm Yuqing, a London-based EdTech freelance teacher who started her journey
        of web development learning in 2022. I have a background in sustainable urban development,
        and code in Python and JavaScript.<br><br>
        I am passionate about learning new
        things and hope to apply my skills to create beautiful and functional Web apps.

      <h2>Why Web Development?</h2>
      <p id="answer">
        My journey in tech started in learning data science because of my love of Python.
        Soon, I realised that I wanted to do something more than cleaning data and training models...
        I want to learn how to build something more practical, and fun.
        <br><br>
        For this reason,
        I started learning responsive web design on Free Codecamp and also completed
        The Odin Project's introduction track. I am now on track to finish University of Helsinki's
        Full Stack Open course by March, bringing me one step closer to achieve my goal
        to become a web developer.
        <br><br>
        However, it is not just about learning new skills. I also want to be able to
        connect with like-minded people and collaborate on projects. After a long period
        of hesitation, I have finally managed to complete the projects with the support of
        Founders and Coders' Wednesday meetup group.
        <br><br>
        I sincerely hope to continue to learn and grow with the community.
